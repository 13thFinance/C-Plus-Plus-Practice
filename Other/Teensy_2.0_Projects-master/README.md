"# Teensy_2.0_Projects" 

This is where I'm dumping the projects I have done with the teensy++ 2.0 by pjrc. 

I will make and release Gerber files for ordering PCBs for the finished projects as well 

as provide the source code for driving the hardware,

that way you could make whatever I'm making quite easily.

:7-Segment LED Nametag

  Description: 
  
    Using common cathode 7-Segment displays and a teensy++ 2.0 we can make a text screen.
