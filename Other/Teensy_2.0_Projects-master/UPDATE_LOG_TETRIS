--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working Project: Teensy Tetris

Update: anima vesta 0.1
  -added a collision function, it is very buggy, but it works to some extent.
    -bug: sucessfully collides at the bottom of the screen, but keeps copying 'set' pixels
Update: anima vesta 0.2
  -patched collision function, much less buggy and it looks like it works properly now
  -added a test function to test for conditions in the code, a way to debug it on runtime
Update: anima vesta 0.3
  -added user input by adding a joystick
  -added the concept of a "pivot point" in order to rotate tetrinominos
    bug:  integrating joy stick and tetris, 
          joystick commands override "set" status? will have to check when I'm free
          -collision may not be setting everything on the screen
Update: anima vesta 0.4
  -fixed joystick bugs and optimized some of the code
  -bug: when moving diagonally into a lit pixel, game freaks out
  -bug: when holding left, the second item spawned sometimes gets repeated vertically
